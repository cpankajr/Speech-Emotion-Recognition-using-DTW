# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-DTW

Authors:

Speech is a vocalized form of human communication. Emotions exert an incredibly powerful
force on human behavior. Emotion plays an important role in a person’s approach to a
particular situation at that particular time. Unable to understand a person’s emotion in a
particular situation may cause a failure of communication. Thus recognizing the emotion
becomes one of the important aspects.

Recently increasing attention has been directed to the study of emotional content of speech
signals, and hence, many systems have been proposed to identify the emotional content of a
spoken utterance.

This project mainly aims to classify 5 emotions namely sad, happy, anger, surprise and
neutral. The input signal is divided into various frames of 20ms and features are extracted
from each frame using MFCC. Later on, DTW is used for classification of emotions.
